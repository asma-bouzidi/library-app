# TODO: Refine App Appearance for Raffinéé Old Money Aesthetic

## Overview
Enhance the Laravel library app's appearance to embody a more "raffinéé old money and proportional" aesthetic. This involves improving spacing, typography, layout proportions, and adding subtle decorative elements for elegance and wealth.

## Tasks
- [x] Update global layout (app.blade.php) with refined spacing, typography, and decorative elements
- [ ] Enhance welcome page (welcome.blade.php) with better proportions and elegance
- [ ] Refine dashboard page (dashboard.blade.php) with improved card layouts and spacing
- [ ] Update home page (home.blade.php) with enhanced book cards and layout
- [ ] Improve auth pages (login.blade.php, register.blade.php) with elegant forms and proportions
- [ ] Refine library pages (books/index.blade.php, create.blade.php, edit.blade.php) with better styling
- [ ] Add custom CSS to app.css for refined shadows, borders, and spacing
- [ ] Test and verify all pages for consistency and proportionality

## Notes
- Use existing old money color palette: cream (#F8F4EC), espresso (#2B1F1A), mocha (#4B3621), sage (#7C8C72), gold (#C6A15B)
- Leverage Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text
- Focus on balanced layouts, larger spacing, and subtle elegance
